# IDEs, compilers, interfaces
## IDEs
In order to turn code into a program that our computer can actually run, we need to first translate it to **machine code** , which represents instructions that tell our computer to perform low-level operations.
> Tools called IDEs, **integrated development environments**, will include features for us to write, translate, and run our code.

## compilers
> A compiler is a program that can convert one language to another, such as source code to machine code:

# Functions, arguments, return values, variables
A **string** is a number of characters or words that we want to treat as text. We must surround strings with "double quotes" in C. And finally we need a semicolon;. 

## %s
With `%s`, weâ€™re adding a placeholder for `printf` to format our string. Then, outside our string, we pass in the variable as another argument with `answer`, separating it from the first argument with a comma`,`.

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");
    printf("Hello, %s\n", answer);
    return 0;
}

```

# header files, commands
## Header files
> Header files, like `stdio.h`, tells our compiler which libraries to load into our program. 

## commands
- cd, for changing our current directory (folder)
- cp, for copying files and directories
- ls, for listing files in a directory
- mkdir, for making a directory
- mv, for moving (renaming) files and directories
- rm, for removing (deleting) files
- rmdir, for removing (deleting) directories

# Types, format codes, operators
## Data Types
- bool, a Boolean expression of either true or false
- char, a single character like a or 2
- double, a floating-point value with more digits than a float
- float, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
- int, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
- long, integers with more bits, so they can count higher than an int
- string, a string of characters

## Format codes
> For `printf`, there are different placeholders for each type, called **format codes**.
- `%c` for chars
- `%f` for floats or doubles
- `%i` for ints
- `%li` for long integers
- `%s` for strings

```C
// In the `calculator.c`
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(viod) {
    // Prompt user for x
    int x = get_int("x: ");
    
    // Prompt user for y
    int y = get_int("y: ");

    // Perform addition
    printf("%i\n", x+y)
}
```

```
$ make calculator
$ ./calculator
x: 1000000000
y: 1000000000
2000000000

$ ./calculator
x: 2000000000
y: 2000000000
-294967296
```

It turns out that data types each use a fixed number of bits to store their values. An `int` in our virtual environment uses 32 bits, which can only contain about four billion (2**32) different values. But since integers can be positive or negative, the highest positive value for an `int` can only be about two billion, with a lowest negative value of about negative two billion.

We can change our program to store and display the result as a `long`, with more bits.
```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Prompt user for x
    long x = get_long("x: ");

    // Prompt user for y
    long y = get_long("y: ");

    // Perform addition
    printf("%li\n", x + y);
}
```
