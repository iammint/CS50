# IDEs, compilers, interfaces

## IDEs

In order to turn code into a program that our computer can actually run, we need to first translate it to **machine code** , which represents instructions that tell our computer to perform low-level operations.

> Tools called IDEs, **integrated development environments**, will include features for us to write, translate, and run our code.

## compilers

> A compiler is a program that can convert one language to another, such as source code to machine code:

# Functions, arguments, return values, variables

A **string** is a number of characters or words that we want to treat as text. We must surround strings with "double quotes" in C. And finally we need a semicolon;.

## %s

With `%s`, we’re adding a placeholder for `printf` to format our string. Then, outside our string, we pass in the variable as another argument with `answer`, separating it from the first argument with a comma`,`.

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");
    printf("Hello, %s\n", answer);
    return 0;
}

```

# Header files, commands

## Header files

> Header files, like `stdio.h`, tells our compiler which libraries to load into our program.

Header files ending in `.h` include prototypes like `void meow(int n);`. Then, library files will include the actual implementation of each of those functions.

## commands

- cd, for changing our current directory (folder)
- cp, for copying files and directories
- ls, for listing files in a directory
- mkdir, for making a directory
- mv, for moving (renaming) files and directories
- rm, for removing (deleting) files
- rmdir, for removing (deleting) directories

# Types, format codes

## Data Types

- bool, a Boolean expression of either true or false
- char, a single character like a or 2
- double, a floating-point value with more digits than a float
- float, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
- int, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
- long, integers with more bits, so they can count higher than an int
- string, a string of characters

## Format codes

> For `printf`, there are different placeholders for each type, called **format codes**.

- `%c` for chars
- `%f` for floats or doubles
- `%i` for ints
- `%li` for long integers
- `%s` for strings

```C
// In the `calculator.c`
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main(viod) {
    // Prompt user for x
    int x = get_int("x: ");

    // Prompt user for y
    int y = get_int("y: ");

    // Perform addition
    printf("%i\n", x+y)
}
```

```
$ make calculator
$ ./calculator
x: 1000000000
y: 1000000000
2000000000

$ ./calculator
x: 2000000000
y: 2000000000
-294967296
```

It turns out that data types each use a fixed number of bits to store their values. An `int` in our virtual environment uses 32 bits, which can only contain about four billion (2\*\*32) different values. But since integers can be positive or negative, the highest positive value for an `int` can only be about two billion, with a lowest negative value of about negative two billion.

We can change our program to store and display the result as a `long`, with more bits.

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Prompt user for x
    long x = get_long("x: ");

    // Prompt user for y
    long y = get_long("y: ");

    // Perform addition
    printf("%li\n", x + y);
}
```

# Conditionals, Boolean expressions

## const

The `const` keyword tells our compiler to ensure that the value of this variable isn't changed, and by convention the name of the variable should be in all uppercase.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(viod) {
    const int MINE = 2;
    int points = get_int("How many points did you lose? ");
    if(points < MINE)
    {
        printf("You lost fewer points than me")
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Fighting!")
    }
}
```

# Loops

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void meow(int n);
int main(void) {
    int n = get_int("How many times should I meow? ");
    meow(n);
}
void meow(int n) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("meow~\n");
    }
}
```

We define our function with `void meow(int n)`. The `void` means that there isn't a return value for our function.

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n;
    do
    {
        n = get_int("Size: ");
    }
    while (n < 1);

    // For each row
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        // For each column
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            // Print a brick
            printf("#");
        }

        // Move to next row
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

# Imprecision, Integer overflow

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Prompt user for x
    float x = get_float("x: ");

    // Prompt user for y
    float y = get_float("y: ");

    // Divide x by y
    float z = x / y;

    printf("%f\n", z);
}
```

```
$ make calculator
$ ./calculator
x: 2
y: 3
0.666667
$ ./calculator
x: 1
y: 10
0.100000
$
```

We can change `printf("%f.2\n", z)` to make it print out two decimal places.

But if we change our program to print fifty decimal places with printf("%.50f\n", z);. We’ll compile and run our program again:

```
$ make calculator
$ ./calculator
x: 2
y: 3
0.66666668653488159179687500000000000000000000000000
$ ./calculator
x: 1
y: 10
0.10000000149011611938476562500000000000000000000000
```

It turns out that this is called **floating-point imprecision**.

> Floating-point imprecision refers to the inability for computers fundamentally to represent all possible real numbers 100% precisely.

So, our computer has to store the closest value it can, leading to imprecision.

Similar, when we had three bits and needed to count higher than seven (or 111), we added another bit to represent eight with 1000. But if we only had three bits available, the “next” number would be 000, since we wouldn’t have a place for the extra 1. This problem is called **integer overflow**, where an integer can only be so large given a finite number of bits.

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    float amount = get_float("Dollar Amount: ");
    int pennies = amount * 100;
    printf("Pennies: %i\n", pennies);
}
```

```
$ make pennies
$ ./pennies
Dollar Amount: .99
Pennies: 99
$ ./pennies
Dollar Amount: 1.23
Pennies: 123
$ ./pennies
Dollar Amount: 4.20
Pennies: 419
```

It turns out that there’s imprecision in storing the float we get from the user (4.20 might be stored as 4.199999...), and so when we multiply it and display it as an integer, we see 419.

We can try to solve this by rounding:

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    float amount = get_float("Dollar Amount: ");
    int pennies = round(amount * 100);
    printf("Pennies: %i\n", pennies);
}
```
